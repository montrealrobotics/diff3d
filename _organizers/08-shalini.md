Shalini De Mello is a Principal Research Scientist at NVIDIA. She obtained her PhD degree in ECE from the University of Texas at Austin in 2008. Her research interests are in learning with limited labels or data (self-supervised viewpoint estimation and 3D reconstruction; and learned propagation) and human-centric computer vision (gaze, and 2D and 3D head pose estimation; hand gesture recognition; and face detection). Since 2013, her research at NVIDIA has significantly advanced human-computer interaction and pioneered the development of NVIDIAâ€™s DriveIX product for AI-based automotive interfaces. She has been an active program committee member for CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, UAI and IJCAI for many years and has previously organized successful tutorials and workshops at ECCV and CVPR.
