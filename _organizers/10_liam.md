Liam Paull is an assistant professor at l'Université de Montréal, the head of the Montreal Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL), and an associate member of Mila. His lab focuses on robotics problems including building representations of the world (such as for simultaneous localization and mapping), modeling of uncertainty, and building better workflows to teach robotic agents new tasks (such as through simulation or demonstration). Previous to this, Liam was a research scientist at CSAIL MIT where he led the TRI funded autonomous car project. He was also a postdoc in the marine robotics lab at MIT where he worked on SLAM for underwater robots. He obtained his PhD from the University of New Brunswick in 2013 where he worked on robust and adaptive planning for underwater vehicles. He is a co-founder and director of the Duckietown Foundation, which is dedicated to making engaging robotics learning experiences accessible to everyone. He has organized several recent workshops at top machine learning and robotics conferences, including: IROS 2020 workshop on Benchmarking Autonomous Driving, the AI Driving Olympics live competition at ICRA 2019-2020 and NeurIPS 2018-2020, RSS 2016 workshop on Geometry and Beyond - Representations, Physics, and Scene Understanding for Robotics, and the ICRA 2016 workshop on Marine Robot Navigation and Localization. More recently, he has also served as program chair for the (virtual) Computer Robot Vision (CRV) 2020 conference.
