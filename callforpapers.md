The primary focus areas of this workshop are:

* **Differentiable geometric computer vision** techniques, including, but not limited to, differentiable depth and pose estimation, feature extraction and matching pipelines, pointset alignment, reconstruction pipelines, and their applications.
* **Differentiable geometry processing and graphics** tools which are increasingly being adopted into vision pipelines, including, but not limited to, differentiable mesh manipulation, rendering, higher-order light transport, and their applications.
* **Applications and limitations** of differentiable methods. Differentiable graphics and rendering might allow for more accurate novel viewpoint synthesis. Differentiable rendering is being used increasingly used for self-supervised 3D reconstruction from a single image. Implicit representations are being learned via differentiable rendering [21]. However, there are also limitations: gradients are not always useful in long-horizon scenarios; differentiable methods are often applicable only where precise process models are available; they also require good initializations. How can differentiable methods be combined with gradient-free optimization (or other techniques) to circumvent these issues?

We solicit submissions of varying lengths and scope, as prescribed below. Each paper will receive at least 2 anonymous peer reviews from our program committee. We do not have a separate rebuttal / author response phase.

* **Archival submissions (due 2 August, 2021)** are expected to be full papers (max. 8 pages in the [ICCV template](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/iccv2021AuthorKit.zip)) and will be published in the proceedings of ICCV workshops. They are to be adequately anonymized (for [**double anonymous**](https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/double-anonymous-faqs/#:~:text=Double%2Danonymous%20peer%20review%20is,when%20carrying%20out%20peer%20review.) review) and abide by the [ICCV author guidelines](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#policies).
* **Non-archival submissions (due 1 September, 2021)** are short papers (max. 4-pages in the [ICCV template](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/iccv2021AuthorKit.zip)), reporting unpublished work, work under submission to another venue, or recently published work at a conference other than ICCV 2021. Note that, when submitting work under review at another concurrent venue, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that submission to this workshop would not constitute a violation of the dual submission policies of either venue. These submissions need not be anonymized and will undergo **single anonymous** peer review (i.e., reviewers know the identities of authors; but authors do not know the identities of reviewers). Papers rejected from the archival track are permitted to be submitted to this track.
* **Early-submission mentorship track**: Our call for papers includes an early-submission mentorship track that pairs authors with experienced researchers who have committed to providing meaningful feedback to help polish papers for general submission. This program facilitates a private dialogue between the mentee and mentor with the goal of fostering an inclusive and supportive research community. Paper submissions to the mentorship track are to be true drafts with at least 80% of work completed. Mentors are expected to provide a timely initial review of the draft submission and are encouraged to continue to engage with the mentee as they prepare for their final submission. Papers are due **2 August 2021** and are expected to be (max. 4-pages in the [ICCV template](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/iccv2021AuthorKit.zip)). These submissions need not be anonymized, and will be paired with mentors by **7 August 2021**. The authors will closely work on the mentor's feedback and are expected to make a final submission by **1 September 2021**.
