title: Differentiable Meshing
time: 1400
abstract: Triangle meshes remain the most popular data representation for surface geometry. Unfortunately, the combinatorial nature of the triangulation prevents taking derivatives over the space of possible meshings of any given surface. As a result, using modern optimization frameworks typically used in deep learning for the tasks of generating and manipulating meshes has been a challenging task. This talk will describe a deep learning method for mesh generation and a differentiable mesh representation. My ultimate goal will be to show that differentiability is an important key towards constructing more accurate and efficient shape reconstruction methods.
