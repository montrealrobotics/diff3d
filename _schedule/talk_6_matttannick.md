title: Investigating Positional Encodings in Coordinate Based Networks
time: 1500
abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable novel view synthesis of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. In the past year these representations have received interest from the community due to their simplicity to implement and their high quality results. In this talk I will discuss some of the follow up projects we have worked on to improve and expand NeRFs, specifically positional encodings. I will discuss the paper mipNeRF which uses anti-aliased positional encodings to improve results.
