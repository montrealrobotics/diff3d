title: Why Do We Need Domain-Specific Languages for (Differentiable) Visual Computing?
time: 1430
abstract: The success of deep learning can be largely credited to domain-specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which made deep learning accessible to a large crowd of researchers and practitioners. However, these frameworks are designed with layered neural network architectures in mind, and are insufficient for more complex visual computing programs (ray tracing, geometry processing, physics simulation, patchmatch, Markov random fields, graphcut, etc). Differentiable programming requires us to explore the large visual computing toolbox outside of convolution or matrix multiplication layers. Therefore, we need new differentiable domain-specific languages for achieving such exploration. I believe one way to address the complexity in visual computing programming is to decouple the mathematical complexity from the implementation. I will briefly discuss a few of our works in this direction.
