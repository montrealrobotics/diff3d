title: Accelerating 3D deep learning with PyTorch3D
time: 1530
abstract: PyTorch3D is a fast, modular and differentiable library for 3D deep learning built to be easily used in deep learning pipelines with 3D data. It features tools for heterogeneous batching of 3D inputs, differentiable rendering of meshes point clouds and volumes, and several common 3D operators and loss functions. This talk will cover the key features of the PyTorch3D library, practical examples and research use cases.
