title: GRAF - Generative Radiance Fields for 3D-aware Image Synthesis
time: 1415
abstract: In this talk, I will present our work on Generative Radiance Fields (GRAF) for 3D-controllable image synthesis. We make significant headway on synthesizing 3D consistent images from controllable viewpoints training with unposed 2D images only. Our key contribution is to combine the recent advances in coordinate-based neural representations with generative adversarial networks. In contrast to previous methods, this enables our approach to scale to high image resolutions and high image fidelity while preserving 3D consistency.
