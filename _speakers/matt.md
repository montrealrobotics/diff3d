I am currently pursuing a PhD in the computer science and electrical engineering department at UC Berkeley. I am advised by Ren Ng and Angjoo Kanazawa, and funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program. Previously I completed my undergrad and Masters of Engineering at MIT in the Camera Culture group. My topics of interest include computer vision, computational imaging, and graphics. I am particularly interested in 3D reconstruction for applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics.
