Vincent Sitzmann just finished his Ph.D. in the Stanford Computational Imaging Laboratory, moving on to a Postdoc at MIT's CSAIL. His research interest lies in neural scene representations - the way neural networks learn to represent information on our world. His goal is to allow independent agents to reason about our world given visual observations, such as inferring a complete model of a scene with information on geometry, material, lighting etc. from only a few observations, a task that is simple for humans, but currently impossible for AI. He has previously worked on differentiable camera pipelines, VR and human perception.
