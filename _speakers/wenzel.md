Wenzel Jakob is Assistant Professor at EPFL (Laussane, Switzerland), where he leads the EFPL's Realistic Graphics Lab. His research revolves around inverse graphics, material appearance modeling and physically based rendering algorithms. He is interested in simulations that produce realistic images of our world, to reconcile the resulting data with physical measurements, and to solve complex inverse problems using differentiable simulations.
